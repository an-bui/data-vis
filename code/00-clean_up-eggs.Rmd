```

### 0. Set up
```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```

```{r data}
egg_shape <- read_csv(here::here("data", "Stoddard_et_al-egg_shape.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  dplyr::select(1:7)
```

### 1. Cleaning
```{r}
ord <- egg_shape %>% 
  group_by(order) %>% 
  summarize(mean_asym = mean(asymmetry),
            sd_asym = sd(asymmetry),
            mean_elli = mean(ellipticity),
            sd_elli = sd(ellipticity))
```

### 2. Figures
```{r elli-asym}
elli_asym <- ggplot(egg_shape, aes(x = ellipticity, y = asymmetry)) +
  geom_point()

elli_asym
```
